Apple stands out as a noteworthy case study for effective web design, characterised by its simple yet elegant interface, user-friendly design, and seamless cross-device integration.

Breakpoints:
Apple employs two key breakpoints in its web design, set at 734px and 1068px widths, respectively. These breakpoints facilitate the creation of two distinct page layouts â€“ one optimised for the mobile or portrait version, and the other tailored for desktops in landscape mode. While the two breakpoints technically result in three distinct web layouts, the final one is essentially a scaled-up version of the landscape design. This strategic use of breakpoints ensures a responsive and tailored user experience across various devices.
Example: Upon reaching the mobile breakpoint, the webpage will automatically switch to an image better suited for the portrait layout of mobile devices.

Layout issues:
Apple excels in averting layout issues by meticulously adhering to responsive design principles. A key element is the adoption of mobile-first design, facilitating seamless upscaling to larger screens. The minimalist design further contributes to effortless and effective responsive web design, significantly reducing the workload required for implementation.
Example: An instance of a dynamic breakpoint on Apple's page is evident in the navigation bar, which changes into a dropdown menu when the navbar would extend to multiple lines.

Hierarchy:
Apple employs several strategies to enhance the hierarchy of its website. This includes captivating the audience with large, high-quality images, precise sectioning, the judicious use of concise information, and a gradual increase in the presentation of details. The emphasis is consistently placed on highlighting essential information, ensuring a focused and engaging user experience.
Example: While serving as a content-rich section, like the comparison tool for their diverse products, each category provides only crucial information. The focus is on accentuating details users are interested in, particularly concentrating on product differences.



youtube.com
YouTube's front-end web design stands out for its user-friendly interface and adaptability across devices. It prioritises efficient content delivery, ensuring fast video playback. The design maintains a cohesive look, seamlessly integrating innovative features while effectively handling a diverse range of content.

Fluid Grids:
The fundamental element of YouTube's website lies in its utilisation of fluid grids. As a content delivery service requiring adaptability and predictability, employing a fluid grid is crucial for efficiently delivering content to users.
Example: This design approach is evident when comparing the desktop and phone versions of the webpage. The design remains largely consistent, with the only noticeable change being a reduction in the amount of content to maintain readability.

Mobile First Design:
Unlike Apple.com, YouTube faces the unique challenge of showcasing extensive content, especially on smaller devices. Its mobile-first design is evident through the integration of controls tailored for mobile devices. The scrolling behaviour and the widely embraced 'Pull-to-Refresh' feature emphasise the common bidirectional scrolling, streamlining the user experience. This design approach enhances overall user interaction on these platforms.

Harmonic Finance's website exemplifies a strong grasp of front-end web design principles, resulting in a professional and visually appealing platform. This expertise is particularly evident in the thoughtful application of typography and colour. 

Colour:
Harmonic Finance's website establishes a robust thematic identity with its colour palette, predominantly featuring shades of light green, white, and black. The website maintains a consistent and professional appearance, contributing to an enhanced user experience. Additionally, the website excels at leveraging this colour theming to improve contrast and readability. The well-thought-out colour palette ensures a high contrast between text and background, enhancing readability and creating a visually balanced interface. This leaves a positive and lasting impression on both clients and potential customers, not to mention the additional benefits of Light Green Symbolism and Brand Identity created with the strong colour theming.
Example: To showcase the website's adept use of colour, all buttons designed to navigate to different pages are consistently themed with the same colour.

Typography 
Typography plays a pivotal role in shaping this website's design, especially considering the emphasis on the advertised product, where images assume a secondary role. A standout feature is the intentional selection of fonts, consistently ensuring clarity and legibility, even in smaller sizes. Thoughtful spacing prevents the page from feeling text-heavy, contributing to a balanced design. Consistency in typography maintains a professional look across the entire site. As highlighted earlier, the strategic use of colour significantly elevates readability, incorporating strong contrasting colours for optimal visual impact. Moreover, the website seamlessly scales for mobile, dynamically shrinking text to ensure an optimal viewing experience for users.

This one-page website serves as a template for the Canberra Modern website, emphasising a mobile-first design, strong theming, and enhanced usability. Inspired by the mobile-first approach of Apple's website, the design incorporates scrolling sections, large images, and prominent text to ensure user-friendly navigation and adaptability across devices.

Drawing inspiration from YouTube, the utilisation of fluid grids within list items facilitates smoother scaling when the page transitions to a more portrait-oriented view.

The primary challenges encountered were related to theming, specifically in attempting to harmonise the colours derived from the logo to maintain a unified aesthetic. The issue arises from the colours not blending seamlessly.

To further develop the template, additional features like a carousel will be incorporated. Ongoing adjustments and consistent theming will be implemented, ensuring elements such as buttons maintain a cohesive orange colour scheme throughout the website.
